		<p >I want to create a website about the impact of Fake News and its real-life consequences. Essentially, I envision a website organized into sections, like the format of the 7 Deadly Sins website we discussed in Week 3. I want my website to consist of extensive information with regards to the most notorious fake news stories out there, as well as tips on how to spot fake news.

		<h1>Week Two's IL Tasks: Audience Research</h1>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: Identifying my audience</h2>
		<p><b>Considerations:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Particular Audiences:</b></br> I think that my topic does lend itself to a particular audience, being students consisting of high schoolers and university students. This is my target audience because teenagers and young adults are often users of social media platforms and are at the prime of their information consumption and learning. Not only are they the heavier users of social media when comparing them to people past their young adult phase, they are also very much at risk of falling victim to fake news if they are not educated enough on the topic. This audience makes up a large demographic of the world population so it is important to focus on educating them on all matters of life. </li>
			<li> <b>Broad / Narrow:</b></br> Although my focus will be on a specific audience, it is an audience that takes up a big part of the demographic in society, in this sense the focus is narrow but accessible to a lot of people. However, this topic is relevant to anyone, even those who aren't students, so it is also very accessible to a broad audience too. </li> 
			<li> <b>Pre-existing Expectations:</b></br> It is hard not to have pre-existing expectations about fake news in our society. I think that the audience will be shocked once they learn about the extreme impacts fake news can actually cause though. The audience might expect to know more than they actually do on the topic too.</li> 
			<li><b> Regular Access:</b></br> I will have access to be able to perform user testing as my target audience consists of peers and friends of mine that I can make use of. </li>
			
			</ul>
			<img src="images/img005-mada-train.jpg"/>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Audience Characteristic</th>
					<td><b>Rationale</b></td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<th>Age</th>
					<td>The age of my audience will be a minimum of 14 years old. There is no maximum age but my target audience will be students at high school and at University. Due to this, my word choice will be of basic proficiency in English language. The tone of writing will be formal and unbiased, due to the website relaying factual information. The medium, being digital media, as it is a website, will be appropriate because most students and young adults will own and make use of various forms of technology. 

					</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<th>Gender</th>
					<td>My audience will be mixed, inclusive of all genders because fake news can affect any gender. The language used on the website will therefore be inclusive. 

					</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<th>Language Proficiency </th>
					<td>My website will require people to have a basic proficiency in the English language. The website will not have complex language due to it being a source of news articles. Therefore the focus will be on inclusivity because every person deserves a right to be able to learn about fake news. The tone will be formal but the writing itself will be easy to understand. 

					</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<th>Education Level

					</th>
					<td>At least high school level of education, so it will be accessible to a broad audience. This level of education is required because once students are in their high school career, most become quite active on social media and therefore enter the realm of potentially being targeted by fake news. </td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<th>Attitude</th>
					<td>My audience might have a sceptical feeling, as they might think they know all that fake news entails, when in reality, they may be surprised at how intricate fake news can be and how fake news can have a real-life impact on society. They also may be intrigued to learn about something that is so relevant to our digital age.</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<th>Knowledge of topic
					</th>
					<td>Most of my audience will have a basic understanding of fake news, but few will be experts. For the basic understanding, there will also be a tab educating them on how to spot fake news. For the experts, they will be able to choose to just read the fake news stories out of interest. 

					</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
					<th>Audience action 
					</th>
					<td>My audience action will be either to click a link for more information about the specific article about the fake news event. Or it will be to input their email so that they can sign up to get updates whenever new articles are posted. 
					</td>
				  </tr>

		<h2>Task 4: Reflective Statement</h2>
		<p> I chose my audience because they fit into the student category. They both had experienced coming across fake news at some point in their lives and both needed to use social media or Google to find information online. The design needs seem to create importance around referencing where information was retrieved from in an accurate manner, a simple and clear layout of the website with no sensationalism, to become a reputable and well-trusted website and to ensure that information on the website is only gathered from reputable sources so that they do not need to spend tons of time fact-checking everything. </p>
		
		<h1>Week Two's Lab Tasks: Establishing Ideas for Design</h1>
		
		<section id="lab1">
		<h2>Task 1: Website Evaluation</h2>
		<p> <b>  BBC News Website  </b></br>
		<b> The Audience:   </b>  
		<li> Can you tell who the project is aimed at?</br>
		Yes. It is clear that it has been created for the general public with a focus on being inclusive by allowing for an international audience too. They are attracting people who want to stay informed about current world events on an international or national scale. The articles on the website are mainly in English, so a basic level of proficiency is needed. They also have content that can appeal to all ages and genders. </li></br>
		<li> Does the range and depth of material seem appropriate for the topic and audience?</br>
		Yes, it is appropriate. The general public is reached by offering a wide variety of stories so that almost anyone can find a topic they would be interested in reading. The international audience is reached by allowing you to search for a specific country’s events and it posts other country’s events on its homepage too. Generally, people trust their news reporting as they report in a formal and factual manner. They also achieve age diversity by offering many different topics, catering for all interests a person may have. </li></br>
		<li>Does the project provide any means of feedback, interaction, experience?</br>
		The BBC News Website offers feedback and interaction by allowing people to reach out to them via email, to follow them on Twitter and post their opinions or feedback. They also have a section on their website where you can make an editorial complaint. The website is easy to navigate, has a user-friendly design with all of its clear headings and subsections. It also states the date an article was posted as well as the minutes or hours since it’s been posted which allows people to read the most recent news daily. 
</li>
</br>
<b> Affordances, conceptual models and signifiers: </b>  </br></br>
		<li> What is the purpose of the project?</br>
		The purpose of the BBC News website is to keep the public informed about daily, weekly and monthly news. They also want to provide a news reporting service that people can trust, by reporting in a very impartial manner. They aim to be inclusive by reporting on various topics and want to educate the general public. 
</li></br>
<li>How easy or complex is the project to use/navigate? </br>
The website is very easy to navigate. There are no conflicting colours and the headings are easy to read, so are the articles. They have various sections on the homepage that can direct you wherever you want to go and it’s quite interactive with it’s Top news section . The website also makes use of multimedia content to make it visually appealing to their audience. 
</li></br>
<li>Can you tell where you have been, where you are and where you can go?</br>
Yes, you are able to redirect yourself on any page or article on the website. 
</li></br>
<li>How does the site use images, text, sound and moving images – are they just illustration or something more?</br>
They incorporate their images into the articles quite well , with an image at the start and in the middle of an article usually, which breaks up the text and gives the user a slight mental break. There isn’t an overuse of images either but an appropriate amount for a news website. The images are all relevant to the text and are not distracting, they look professional. The text isn’t lengthy and is very punchy and to the point. It is basic formal language that would be understood by anyone with a basic level of proficiency in the English language. The headings are in bold and the font isn’t difficult to read. There aren’t many moving images, but rather short videos occasionally, which is more appropriate for this website.
</li>

</br>

<b> Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity
 </b>  </br></br>

		<li>Does it make effective use of layout, graphics, colour? For example: the positioning of information; does the background image or colour enhance the presentation of information; are the foreground and/or text colours contrasted sufficiently?</br>
		The colour scheme of this website is very appropriate and effective. They use basic colours that aren’t harsh on the eye and they stick to the same colours of red and grey. This gives it an authentic feel as you can immediately relate and remember that BBC’s main colour is red, it creates a connection to the audience in a way by making it memorable. The graphics as stated above, are professionally presented and are all relevant to the text. The layout as stated above, is very easy to navigate and understand. This is done by using headings, different sections on the homepage for Live News , and subsections too. 
</li></br>
<li>Does it use symmetry and balance to good effect?
</br>
Yes. The placement of headings, images and sections are all well organized and are visually appealing. It looks well organized which allows for effective reading. 
</li></br>
<li> Is the information, navigation, graphics etc. laid out in a consistent way?
</br>
Yes, as stated above, the information, navigation and graphics are all consistent in their layout. 
</br></br>
<b> Content Design
 </b>  </br></br>
<li> Does the website work on a original problem relevant to the audience?
</br>The BBC website aims to report news, to be a reliable source of information for the general public and do this in an impartial manner. In a way, it is solving a problem that society faces today with fake news taking the world by storm. Often people don’t know what source to trust, but the BBC is known to be trustworthy. </li></br>
<li>Does the range and depth of content provide appropriate coverage of the subject?
</br>
Yes, as stated above they offer news reporting on a local scale, right down to the area or city that you live in. They go as wide as a country level and then international reporting too. The coverage is very wide yet all done in a focused and specific manner. 
</li></br>
<li> How relevant is the content to the subject matter, project aims and intended audience?
</br>
It is extremely relevant to the goals which they set out to accomplish which is to provide impartial current world news. 
</li></br>
<li>Is the content analytical, readable, correct, accompanied by reliable supporting evidence?
</br>Yes, the articles are written in an informative, formal manner with information about the author , place and time it was written. They do not often engage in investigative journalism therefore the focus is on facts, which makes it reliable and there is always evidence available. </li></br>
<li> Does the project display wider knowledge by reference to other works, either in analogue or electronic form?</br>
Yes, depending on what type of article or reporting it is , there will be different references e.g first-hand source, second hand account etc.

		<p><b> Hrodc Website - from Moodle </b></br>
		<b> The Audience:   </b>  
		<li>Can you tell who the project is aimed at?</br>
		
		Barely, I can see that it’s for postgraduate related courses , but it takes a while to figure this out.
</br></br>

<li>Does the range and depth of material seem appropriate for the topic and audience?</br>
No, it’s not easy to navigate and you would have to spend ages scrolling through trying to find your information as there is no clear headings or information provided. 
		</li></br>
		<li>Does the project provide any means of feedback, interaction, experience?
</br>
No it does not, it has various numbers and emails but no information about who it actually is that you’re contacting.
</li></br>
<b> Affordances, conceptual models and signifiers </b>
</br></br>
<li>What is the purpose of the project?</br>
To advertise postgraduate courses 
</li></br>
<li>How easy or complex is the project to use/navigate?
</br>
Extremely complex, it isn’t a user friendly design, it’s text heavy and no hyperlinked headings. 
</li></br>
<li> Can you tell where you have been, where you are and where you can go?
</br>
No, it’s an endless page of text without any clear pathway for a user
</li></br>
<li> How does the site use images, text, sound and moving images – are they just illustration or something more?
</br>
It is too text heavy, has contrasting colours that don’t suit each other, the images are somewhat blurry and don’t look professional. The text colour is difficult to read due to the background image. 
</li>
</br>
<b>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity </b> </br></br>

<li>Does it make effective use of layout, graphics, colour? For example: the positioning of information; does the background image or colour enhance the presentation of information; are the foreground and/or text colours contrasted sufficiently?
</br>
No, the positioning of information is wrong, the background does not enhance the information and the colours make it difficult to read. 
</li>
</br>
<li>Does it use symmetry and balance to good effect?
</br>
There is no symmetry or balance in this website unfortunately. 
</li>
</br>
<li>Is the information, navigation, graphics etc. laid out in a consistent way?
Nothing is consistent about this website. 
</br></br>
<b> Content Design</b>
</br> </br>
<li>Does the website work on a original problem relevant to the audience?
</br>
No, postgraduate students will be looking for a reliable and recognized institution to be doing their degree or short course. Or at bare minimum, they will want to feel a sense of pride and peace when spending their money on education, knowing that it’s a professional institution. But this website goes against all of these fundamentals. </li></br>
<li>Does the range and depth of content provide appropriate coverage of the subject?
</br>
No, there is a lot of repetition and its too lengthy without giving informative information.
</li>
</br>
<li>How relevant is the content to the subject matter, project aims and intended audience?</br>
The relevancy of the subject matter is not reaching any goals or intended audience because of all the reasons stated above. 
</li></br>
<li> Is the content analytical, readable, correct, accompanied by reliable supporting evidence?</br>
It is none of the above, there are no references claiming that this institution is legitimate or a good place to study. The content isn’t readable and it’s very poorly designed. 
</li></br>
<li>Does the project display wider knowledge by reference to other works, either in analogue or electronic form?</br>
None of the above
</li>

<h2>Task 2: Consider Your Audience</h2>

<p> The features on the BBC Website would be very suitable for my audience. I chose to analyze that website because it is somewhat related to my topic in the ways of informing the public with impartial information. For Thomas, interacting with a website that has a user-friendly interface and various multimedia content would be extremely engaging. To have clear bold sections and a good layout might be useful to Rosa when she is needing to quickly analyze information for an essay. It would be good to have a discussion section where people can share their thoughts or experiences of fake news, which could encourage user engagement. A neutral colour scheme would also be useful so that it is not challenging on the eyes. My persona's would've been very happy interacting with the BBC News Website </p>
