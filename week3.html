		My websiteâ€™s primary objective is to empower students with the ability to identify, critically assess and combat fake news effectively. The website aims to equip them with practical skills and knowledge, enabling them to navigate the modern information landscape confidently. I want my audience to gain a heightened awareness of the serious implications of fake news on society and people, as well as the tools and strategies to mitigate these consequences. The website will help them develop media literacy and a more informed approach to news consumption. The language used in my content will be basic formal language, making it accessible to most English language speakers. Lastly, I will ensure that the design of my website is fun and engaging for the users.
