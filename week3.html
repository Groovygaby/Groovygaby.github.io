			<p >I want to create a website about the impact of Fake News and its real-life consequences. Essentially, I envision a website organized into sections, like the format of the 7 Deadly Sins website we discussed in Week 3. I want my website to consist of extensive information with regards to the most notorious fake news stories out there, as well as tips on how to spot fake news.

<b> Audience and Topic: </b></p>
My topic is The Real Life Consequences of engaging with and spreading Fake News. My Audience is high school and university students as this target group is very active on social media. <br><br>
​​”In a recent study conducted at Abdul Aziz University, concerning the influence of social media on the lives of university students, striking findings have come to light. The research, which surveyed 300 female students aged 17 to 29, revealed an astonishing statistic: 97 percent of the students surveyed were active on social media platforms, reflecting the ubiquitous nature of these online networks among young adults.”

<b> Objectives:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Engaging:</b> <br>
	I want to make my website as engaging as possible and due to the studious nature of my target group, I might even include some historical examples of misinformation and show how it was back then vs how it is today. </li>
<li><b>Specific Topics:</b><br> I can create sections based on specific topics that will spike interest from certain students e.g. science, politics or pop culture
</li>
<li>
	<b>Increase Awareness and critical thinking:</b> <br>I want my audience to exit my website feeling as though they have gained a heightened sense of awareness about how to identify fake news and what the consequences are for engaging with it
</li>
<li>
	<b>Identify Fake News: </b><br>I want to teach them the red flags to look out for when interacting with fake news e.g. sensationalism, biased sources and misleading headlines 

</li>
<li>
<b>Case Studies:</b>	<br> I will make use of real-world stories to engage my students and give the website a practical feel. Often students complain about learning things that seem to have little relevance in the real world, this website will make it clear that this is a real-world problem so we need to start working towards the solution. 

</li>
<li>
	<b>Interactive Learning: </b><br>I will try to make the website interface as interactive as possible with audio, video, engaging images and coherent styling throughout the website. Attention spans in our fast-paced world seem to be at an all-time low, so prioritizing these elements is very important. 

</li>
<li>
	<b>Informed Digital Citizens:</b> <br>Lastly, I want to empower students to become informed and responsible digital citizens. I want them to feel that they have power and knowledge that can help them fend off any negative situation online. 

</li>

</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
<b>Age Group:</b><br><br>
I will make sure that my content is relevant to a student-level age group, this will include my content being age-appropriate as well as the language used on my website. There will be no technical jargon and I will ensure clarity throughout all my explanations. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Educational Background: 
		</b><br><br>
		Due to the educational background of students varying slightly, I will ensure that the content is appropriate for all by focusing on basic foundational concepts. I will mainly be reporting on events so it won’t require deep thinking or analytical skills. I want my website to be user-friendly to those of all ages at the core, even though my website is aimed at students, so I will remain mindful of each action I take. 

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Narrative Voice: 
		</b><br><br>
		I will ensure that my narrative voice is professional and somewhat formal. However, I will ensure that it is engaging throughout. Due to this website reporting on news events, there needs to be a professional tone but it won’t impede the ability of students to understand the information. 

	</p>

	<p>

		<b>Navigation Structure: 
		</b><br><br>
		I will adopt a thematic structure that categorizes content by different subject areas e.g. science, politics or pop culture. I have also considered a chronological structure that traces the evolution of fake news over time. These sections will explain the techniques used to spread fake news and explore the psychological and sociological aspects of media manipulation. 

	</p>
	<h2> Task Two:</h2>
	<p> 
	<b>Reflective Statement:</b><br><br>
	As I've been piecing together this website on fake news aimed at high school and university students, I realize that I’m trying to take students on a journey through time. I am doing this by showing them how misinformation has always been around but has changed shape with technology and social media in the mix. The design choices I've made - like the interactive elements and real-life case studies - aren't just to grab attention but they're there to make this issue real and relatable. I mean, it's one thing to read about fake news, but it's another to see and understand how it actually plays out in the real world. Also by breaking down the content into sections like politics and pop culture, I'm hoping to appeal to students with different interests. I've also been mindful about keeping the language clear and professional, yet engaging. It's important that the site feels credible but not content-heavy or overly academic. I know that the current website is quite content-heavy heavy but that’s because it contains all my explanations of why I want to do things in a certain way. The thematic layout is there to help students navigate the content easily, letting them dive deep into the aspects they're most curious about. In short, every part of this website – from its structure to its content – is crafted to not just educate but to empower these students. I want them to leave the site not just more informed, but feeling ready to tackle the challenges of misinformation head-on in their own lives.
