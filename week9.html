			<p >I want to create a website about the impact of Fake News and its real-life consequences. Essentially, I envision a website organized into sections, like the format of the 7 Deadly Sins website we discussed in Week 3. I want my website to consist of extensive information with regards to the most notorious fake news stories out there, as well as tips on how to spot fake news.

		<h1>Week 9 IL Activity: Analysing Digital Video</h1>
		
		<h2>Task 1: Analyse the use of video on the web</h2>
		<p> <b>What are the videos used for?</b><br><br>
			The video content on BBC News provides visual and audio-visual content that complements the written articles and news stories. These videos often show firsthand footage of events, interviews with people or detailed explanations of complex topics. The video content enhances normal news storytelling by offering a dynamic and engaging medium that can help viewers better understand the story. Videos bring a sense of immediacy and authenticity to the news, which makes it more relatable and impactful. Ultimately, videos on the BBC News website enrich the overall news experience by providing a multimedia dimension to the stories they cover. This is particularly important in the digital society we now live in. 
<br><br>
<b>Can you find evidence of video used with intent, which enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal?</b><br><br>
There is definitely evidence of video used with intent, which enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal on the BBC News Website. A significant finding from a survey conducted by the BBC revealed that 80% of people who used closed captions had no hearing loss and 70% of respondents said closed captions improved comprehension. Closed captions are beneficial in several ways, such as when people aren't speaking clearly, technical terms are used or different languages are spoken. They also help with focus and retention of any information that is presented​​​​. This indicates that the BBC's video content, particularly the ones with closed captions is intended to make content more accessible and understandable to a broader audience. This enhances the overall news consumption experience on their website. <br><br>

<br><br>
<b>What benefits and caveats of video use can you witness?</b><br><br>
The use of video on BBC News offers several benefits. The videos provide a more immersive and engaging experience for the audience, allowing for a better understanding of news stories through visual and audio elements. Videos can also convey emotions and situations in real-time that text alone may not fully capture. For instance, with the coverage of the current war in Palestine, people are able to see and feel the effects in a much more immersive way. Moreover, video content can be more accessible for people who prefer visual learning or have difficulty reading text.
On the other hand, there are some caveats associated with the video content. Videos require more data and bandwidth to load which can be problematic for users with limited internet access. Additionally, videos don’t always offer the depth of information that can be found in written articles. 
<br><br>
<b>Is the length of videos suitable?</b><br><br>
Yes, most of the video content on their website is under a minute. This ensures that the viewer’s attention span is well-considered and that people will remain engaged. 
<br><br>
<b>How is video combined with other media (images, text, audio) in order to synthesise a multimedia production?</b><br><br>
The videos usually have an image that best depicts the video’s topic and a caption line. The audio element comes in with recording whatever is being spoken about in each video. Options like closed captions form the text element of the multimedia production. There are also written articles on the same topic if users prefer to read articles rather than watch them. Everything is carefully edited to ensure an effective flow when creating BBC’s multimedia productions.
