		<h1>Fake News and the Real Life Consequences</h1>
		<h2>MAD(A) Project Homepage</h2>

		<p>I want to create a website about the impact of Fake News and its real-life consequences. Essentially, I envision a website organized into sections, like the format of the 7 Deadly Sins website we discussed in Week 3. I want my website to consist of extensive information with regards to the most notorious fake news stories out there, as well as tips on how to spot fake news.
