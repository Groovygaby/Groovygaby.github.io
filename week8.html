			<p >I want to create a website about the impact of Fake News and its real-life consequences. Essentially, I envision a website organized into sections, like the format of the 7 Deadly Sins website we discussed in Week 3. I want my website to consist of extensive information with regards to the most notorious fake news stories out there, as well as tips on how to spot fake news.

		<h1>Week 8 IL Activity:</h1>
		
		<h2>Task 1: Analyse the use of audio on the web </h2>
		<p> The Website I analysed was: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News
		</a><br> <br>
		BBC News offers various audio elements to enrich the user experience and their website primarily utilises audio for speech purposes like news reports, interviews and documentaries. This allows them to deliver news in a captivating manner as listeners can hear directly from a first-hand account. Ambient sounds and sound effects aren’t that popular on the website. However, they use audio and video together when reporting on news e.g. the Palestine conflict, to portray the country’s situation. The benefits of incorporating audio in these ways are manifold: it helps convey nuances of tone and emotion, provides context through sounds and allows visually impaired people to access news. However, it's important to consider caveats such as ensuring that the audio doesn't distract from the content or conflict with the user’s environment e.g. background noise making it difficult to hear a news report.

<h2>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of audio content</h2>
I didn’t find many audio files I wanted to add to my website from the resources provided on Moodle, so I decided to choose an applause sound for the end of my website from the BBC Sound Effects website. This is to congratulate the marker for looking at all my work and to congratulate myself for completing all the necessary tasks.<br><br>
<audio controls>
	<source src="images/master-files/audio002-mada-applause-unedited.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
 </audio>
<br><br>
 I also created my own audio file for a stand-out and relevant piece of audio for my website, which appears on the homepage. I created this audio file because it combines elements of sensationalism, absurdity and believability to create a scenario that can easily fool someone into briefly accepting it as true. It starts with an attention-grabbing headline and uses the authoritative tone of a news source to give off some credibility. As I describe the purported alien invasion in local parks, the script adds ridiculous details like aliens offering snacks. However, these absurdities are presented in a straightforward manner, making it easy for the listener to become absorbed in the story, keeping disbelief at bay for a moment. Ultimately, the script highlights how fake news can manipulate emotions and exploit people's willingness to accept sensational and entertaining stories without critical scrutiny. It emphasises the importance of critical thinking and fact-checking.<br><br>

<h2>Week 8 Lab Task: Audacity Findings</h2>
		<p>
I decided to edit the Applause audio as it had the potential to end earlier as there was a few seconds of silence where the audio was still running. <br><br>

<b>MP3 derivative in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Joint Stereo</b><br><br>
<audio controls>
	<source src="images/audio003-mada-applause-edited-joint.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
 </audio>
<br><br>
This audio file sounded slightly muffled yet intense at the same time which would be cause by the joint stereo aspect, through combining elements of the left and right channels. This audio was cropped but the results won't really be noticeable as the unedited version had a longer playing time, but it was just silence at the end. 
<br><br>
<b>MP3 derivative in Standard (170-210 kbps) quality, Stereo</b><br><br>
<audio controls>
	<source src="images/audio004-mada-applause-edited.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
 </audio>
<br><br>
This audio file was the best of the three, it has a balance of file size and audio quality, it delivers decent sound quality and detail. It also has a wider sound coverage than the others. This audio was cropped but the results won't really be noticeable as the unedited version had a longer playing time, but it was just silence at the end. 
<br><br>
<b> MP3 derivative in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Forced export to mono</b><br><br>
<audio controls>
	<source src="images/audio005-mada-applause-edited-mono.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
 </audio>
<br><br>
The audio remained clear but it sounded less intense, it sounded quieter in a way. This audio was cropped but the results won't really be noticeable as the unedited version had a longer playing time, but it was just silence at the end. It would be fair to say that this audio result was of lower quality than the previous ones.
