			<p >I want to create a website about the impact of Fake News and its real-life consequences. Essentially, I envision a website organized into sections, like the format of the 7 Deadly Sins website we discussed in Week 3. I want my website to consist of extensive information with regards to the most notorious fake news stories out there, as well as tips on how to spot fake news.

	<h1>Week Four Tasks: Design Considerations</h1>
		
		<p> 
<ul>
<li>I want to make my background colour a light grey with a contrast of red headings throughout the website. I got inspired to do this by the 7 Deadly Sins Website as well as the BBC News Website. With my topic, I believe sticking to a consistent colour scheme is best as I don’t want my design considerations to take away from the important content. 
</li><br>
<li>I want to have an image as a banner on my website so that there is something interesting that catches the eye, ideally it will be news-related. I will also want to have a block of text in the banner for each week that describes what I aim to achieve with each week’s task. 
</li><br>
<li>My font family will need to be clearly legible and I want all headings to have styling on them so that they stand out from the rest of the content. I would like it if my text is aligned and all of the sentences are justified as this will make it look neat and appealing. 
</li><br>
<li>I would like to use tables and lists to compile some of my information so that it gives it a nice formatted look, it will also serve to break up the paragraph text which can become repetitive to the eye. 
</li><br>
<li>I also want to ensure that my design considerations favour accessibility throughout the website, this is something that we will explore in the coming weeks. 
</li><br>
<li>I would like to include images, audio and video on my website to create further engagement with the content. Preferably I would create my own audio file so that I can have it relate directly to my audience, this could be displayed on the homepage as a fun add-on. 
</li><br>
<li>I will continue to test the user experience of my website as I build it and will reach out to friends who are within my target audience to test the website and give their opinions on its navigation and accessibility. 
</li>
</ul>
